# harmony-feature

Demo workspace for a Feature team building with Harmony

This repository is where a feature team owns and builds a specific feature that is integrated to the shell.
This allows for a complete independent workflow for the feature team where they can run the complete app in their local environment.

this workspace allows for independent build for the team and even independent deployment to a staging/testing environment of the feature team.

To run the application:

```
bit install
bit run app-shell --watch
```
